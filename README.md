Changes
==================
v0.1.3-Alpha build.5;
 - Fixed Versioning.
 - Added the ability to use W,A,S,D or the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT Arrows to move the ship.

v0.1.3-Alpha build.4;
 - Bullets from both the player and enemies, ignore/go through power-ups (Sort of a bug since power-ups should be ignored).
 - Bullets from the enemies stop when hitting another enemy, but does not damage the receiving enemy.
 -- Minor Optimization for late-game, when frame rate gets munched and also probably to hard for player, lol.
 - Added a few things to the TODO List.

TODO LIST
==================
 - Indicator for Player Shield.
 - Way to recharge, increase Player Shield when depleted/deactivated.
 - Enemies with shields, to mix things up a bit.
